=================== KAFKA CLUSTER SETUP =========================
To setup Kafka in a cluster, first we must have the zookeeper cluster setup and running, so please complete that first. 
Once you are done, proceed with the below steps.

Suppose your -
Zookeeper Nodes are: 198.168.1.12:2181, 192.168.1.13:2181
Kafka Standalone Nodes are: 192.168.1.9:9092,192.168.1.15:9092

STEP 1: Now navigate to the kafka root folder of each computer and modify the server.properties in "config" sub folder:
> cd $KAFKA_HOME
> gedit config/server.properties

In the server.properties file, 
1) search the line "zookeeper.connect" and change it to:
zookeeper.connect=192.168.1.12:2181,192.168.1.13:2181

2) search the line "broker.id" (unique id for each broker node) and change it to:  
broke.id=1    //(on computer 192.168.1.9)
broker.id=2   //(on computer 192.168.1.15)

3) search the line "host.name" and change it to 
host.name=192.168.1.9  //(on computer 192.168.1.9) 
host.name=192.168.1.15  //(on computer 192.168.1.15)
If lines are not there then make the entries

4) Make sure that the line 
port=9092 
is there and uncommented in the server.properties
If not there then make the entry, however it'll be there in the file

Save and close the server.properties. 
---------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: Now start the kafka server on each computer.
>cd $KAFKA_HOME
> bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

At this point, the kafka cluster is set up and running. 
-----------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3: VERIFICATION
We can test the cluster by creating a topic named "v-topic":
> bin/kakfa-topics.sh --create --zookeeper 192.168.1.12:2181 --partitions 2 --replication-factor 1 --topic v-topic

Please note that the hostname/ip:port passed in above command after zookeeper is that of one of the zookeeper servers only 
and not the kafka server.


Now run the following commands to list the topics in the kafka brokers:
> bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 192.168.1.12:2181 --list

Now run the following commands to get a description how the topic "v-topic" is partitioned in each broker:
> bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper 192.168.1.12:2181 --topic v-topic

To test the producer and consumer interaction, let's start a consoler producer on the computer 192.168.1.9 by running the 
following command on that computer's terminal:
> cd $KAFKA_HOME
> bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 192.168.1.9:9092,192.168.1.15:9092 --topic v-topic

Now open a terminal of the other computer 192.168.1.15 and start a console consumer:
> cd $KAFKA_HOME
> bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper 192.168.1.12:2181 --topic v-topic --from-beginning
Here pass any of the zookeeper nodes ip/host:port in the above command unline in the producer command where you pass 
the ips:port of the brokers


Begin to type something in the console producer on 192.168.1.9 terminal and press ENTER, 
you will see the output displayed in the console consumer on 192.168.1.15 terminal.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Not required for Production - Try if only you want it
Note:
It is also ok to set up multiple Kafka brokers on the same computer. For example, if we want to have two Kafka brokers running at 
two different ports on computer 192.168.2.2, say:

192.168.2.2:9092
192.168.2.2:9093

Now all that we need to do is to duplicate the server.properties after it is updated, and rename it server1.properties in the 
same "config" folder (note that name is not important, can be anything that make sense). Now in the server1.properties, 
modify to have the following settings:

broker.id=3
log.dirs=/var/kafka1-logs
port=9093

Save and close server1.properties (remember to create the folder /var/kafka1-logs with write permission), 
open two terminal in 192.168.2.2 and run the following command in the first terminal to start a kafka broker at port 9092:
> $KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-server-start.sh $KAFKA_HOME/config/server.properties

On the second terminal, run the following command to start a second kafka broker at port 9093:
> $KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-server-start.sh $KAFKA_HOME/config/server1.properties

Now you will have two kafka brokers running on 192.168.2.2 on two different ports. To include the second broker for the 
console producer, change its start command to:
> $KAKFA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 

192.168.2.2:9092,192.168.2.2:9093,192.168.2.4:9092 --topic v-topic
