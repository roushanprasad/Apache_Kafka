# Apache_Kafka
Detailed steps and descriptions for setting up Apache Kafka in standalone and multi node cluster mode.
Refer 'standalone_install' for standalone installation of apache kafka.
Refer 'cluster_install' for multi node cluster installation of apache kafka.

#Pre-Requisites:
Apache zookeeper is required for Kafka to run on multinode clustered server. Please install the apache zookeeper first from 'https://github.com/roushanprasad/Apache-Zookeeper' and then proceed for kafka cluster installation. If you wish to run apache kafka on standalone mode, zookeeper is not required as kafka comes with a pre-built zookeeper which is sufficient for a standalone execution of Kafka.
